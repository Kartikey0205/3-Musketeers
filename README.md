## What is Toxic Parenting ?
   #### When people discuss toxic parents they are typically describing parents who consistently behave in ways that cause guilt, fear, or obligation in their children. Their actions aren't isolated events, but patterns of behavior that negatively shape their child's life.
The thing is, parents are human beings. And that means that they may make mistakes, yell too much, or do potentially damaging things to their kids â€” even unintentionally. But their impulse is to do better and make things right.
If you have self centered behavior, physical and verbal abuse, controlling behavior, manipulative behavior, then you are toxic and damaging your child's mental health. 
When a child grows up in toxic environment, he /she projects the same. They are anger issues, trust issues, they will isolate themselves, will doubt everything and may abuse someone physically. 

## Why is toxic parenting a issue? 
  ####  Children learn what they see and what they experience. If they are in a toxic environment then they will project the same to others, even became toxic to their children in future. Toxicity is negative and it damages us and the people around us. To make our country better, we need to start ourselves first. We should be positive with ourselves and project positivity to others.

## How to solve this issue? 
 ####   We should make the parents realise what they are projecting on their kids. We can develop a website which takes input from the parents and calculate how toxic their parenting is and gives a report of what they need to improve. 
We can make a web page for the children and ask them questions related to their relationship with parents and friends. We can see what their mindset is and if they require a therapist or not.


## How to get revenue? 
  #### If people take that test via web page, they will encourage people to take the same test. In starting we will make it free for all but later when we become popular then we'll charge money. We'll provide therapy sessions and guide them but it will be under certain plan which will be charged.
